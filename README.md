# Goldfish API

This is a supporting backend API for the [Reflections of Goldfish](https://blog.huhtanen.eu/) blog. At first its pupose
is to provide a comment system for the blog but in the future it might also serve other purposes.

The API is built using the [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) Framework and runs on AWS Lambda.
